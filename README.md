# Pomodoro
## A pomodoro style timer

This was a weekend project I decided to start after realizing I need to start doing more actual coding! The program utilizes Java's
Timer and TimerTask classes to count down the timer and keep track of time. Prior to this project I did not realize that Java's
Timer started on a new thread. This was most definitely a challenge since I was relying on my assumption that everything would run
on one single thread. My solution was a quite jumbled timertask code block, but I certainly learned a lot from this project! In the
future I may revisit this and clean it up a bit.
